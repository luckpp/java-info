# Java Fundamentals: Collections

I gathered all infirmation that is new for me from the following Pluralsight course: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/java-fundamentals-collections/table-of-contents

# Defining and iterating collections

- all Java collections inerfaces extend `java.util.Collection`
  - `List`: have order and indexing
  - `Set` - `SortedSet`: have distinct elements
  - `Queue` - `Deque` (double ended queue - stack): preserve the order in which elements have been added
- `Map` - `SortedMap`: contain key-value elements

- there are often more than one implementation for an interface:
  - a LinkedList is very efficient for inserting new elements
  - an ArrayList is very efficient for accessing inserted elements

- implementations
  - `List` (`ArrayList` & `LinkedList`)
  - `Set` (`HashSet`) - `SortedSet` (`TreeSet`)
  - `Queue` (`PriorityQueue`) - `Deque` (`LinkedList` `ArrayDeque`)
  - `Map` (`HashMap`) - `SortedMap` (`TreeMap`)

## Iterators

- the **diamond** operator introduced in Java 7, the generic type parameter will be infered from the context:

```java
Collection<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
```

- with iterators you can interate over a collection and remove elements from the collection:

```java

for (Product product: products) {
  if (product.getWeight() > 10) {
    products.remove(product);
  }
}
```

NOTE: Useful library http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/.


# Collections with Iteration: Lists

- ArrayList
- LinkedList

- in order to return a view of a list use
```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList(new String[]{"00", "11", "22", "33"});
List<String> view = list.subList(0, 2);
view.set(0, "zero");
System.out.println(list.get(0)); // will print "zero"
```


# Collections with Uniqueness: Sets

## HashSet

### The equals()/hashCode() contract

If two objects are equal is important that they have the same hash-code:

```java
// if
obj.equals(other);

// than
obj.hasCode() == other.hashCode();
```

The correct hashCode implementation is to combine the hashCode information from each other field:
- for objects: result = 31 * result + obj.hashCode() // it is impotant to use a prime number in order to reduce collisions
- for arrays:  Arrays.hashCode()
- for longs: (l ^ (l >>> 32))
- for floats: Float.floatToIntBits(f)

NOTE: 
- **In most of the cases the IDSs are able to generate both the equals() and the hashCode() methods.**
- **The rules above are important only to be able to understand other people's code.**
- **Java 7 introduced a class calles Objects**:
  - use Objects.hash(...)
  - use Objects.equals(...)

## TreeSet

- based upon a TreeMap
	- uses a binary tree with required sort order
- keeps elements in the given order
	- see SortedSet and NavigableSet
- **when instantiating a `TreeSet` is important to either:**
  - **put objects that implement the comparator interface**
  - **or to provide the constructor with a comparator**

## EnumSet

- is a specialized data structure 
	- allows to store only enum objects
- use when sorting sets of enums

## SortedSet & NavigableSet

- define a new semantic for sets that store elements in a sorted order
- offers methods for creating **views** (`tailSet(...)`, `headSet(...)`, `subSet(...)`)

# Collections qith Modification Order:  Queues, Deques, and Stacks

## Queues

- FIFO data structure
- example of usage:
```java
Queue<string> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
```

## Priority Queues

- the order in which the elements come out is defined by a priority
- example of usage:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Comparator<String> COMP = new Comparator<String>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(String o1, String o2) {
                return o1.compareTo(o2) * -1;
            }
        };
        Queue<String> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(COMP);

        pq.add("a");
        pq.add("c");
        pq.add("b");
        String item;
        while ((item = pq.poll()) != null) {
            System.out.println(item);
        }
    }
}
```

## Stacks

- LIFO data structure
- NOTE: **`java.util.Stack` is deprecated and you should not use it**
- example of usage:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Deque<String> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        stack.push("1");
        stack.push("2");
        stack.push("3");
        String item;
        while (stack.size() > 0) {
            System.out.println(stack.pop());
        }
    }
}
```

## Summary

- there are multimple concurrent implementations of Queue
- there are 2 key implementations:
	- ArrayDeque
		- RingBuffer based implementations
		- constant time for additio/removal
		- less memory, faster
		- no random access
	- LinkedList
		- very seldom used as a Queue
		- has random access! but its O(N)
		- allows null elements
- try to avoid `Stack` (which is deprecated) and the use of `LinkedList` as queue
