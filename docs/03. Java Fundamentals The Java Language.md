# Java Fundamentals: The Java Language

I gathered all infirmation that is new for me from the following Pluralsight course: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/java-fundamentals-language/table-of-contents

# Packages

- Java does not require that packages should be bound to a folder structure but most of IDEs do so


# Variables, Data Type, and Math Operators

## 1. Integer
- byte (8 bits)
- short (16 bits)
- int (32 bits)
- long (64 bits)

NOTE: for long literals use the suffix `L`
```java
long l = 10L;
```

## 2. Floating Point
- float (32 bits)
- double (64 bits)

NOTE:
- for floating point literals use the suffix `f`
```java
float distance = 1.7f;
```
- if a literal is used without any suffix than the compiler assumes it is a double, but you can also make it explicitly a double by putting `d` at the end:
```java
double d = 1.7;
double d = 1.7d;
```

## 3. Character

- the `char` stores a single Unicode character
```java
char regularU = 'U';
char accentedU = '\u00DA';
```

## 4. Boolean

```java
boolean iLoveJava = true;
```

# Syntax

## 1. Logical operators

- &, |, ^, !
- &&, || (which are short-cut operators)

## 2. Arrays and for loops

```java
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3 };
for (int number: numbers) { // this is the for-each statement
	System.out.println(number);
}
```

## 3. Switch

- from the primitive types, only char and int types can be used in swotch
```java
switch (test-value) {
	case value-1:
		statements
	case value-2:
		statements
	...
	default:
		statements
}
```

# Classes

## Access modifiers
- no access modifier means that access is allowed from within the same package
- once a class is 'public' than there is the requirement that the name of the source file that contains this class has the {same_name_as_class}.java

Method signature is made of 3 parts:
- name
- number of parameters
- type of each parameter

Variable number of parameters:
- place an ellipse after the parameter type
- can only be the last parameter
```java
public void method(int... list) { // list is actually an arrays
	for (int item: list) {
		// ...
	}
}

//works for both type of calls:
method(new int[] {1, 2, 3});
//or
method(1, 2, 3);
```

# Class Inheritance

- add the @Override anotation to tell the compiler that you are override a method

# Data Types

## Strings

- store a sequence of Unicode characters stored using UTF-16 encoding

```java
String s1 = "I love";
s1 += " Java";

String s2 = "I";
s2 += " love Java";

if (s1 == s2)
	// will not reach here
	
if (s1.equals(s2))
	// will reach here; but is inexpensive
	
String s3 = s1.intern();
String s4 = s2.intern();

if (s3 == s4)
	// will reach here since intern() will ensure that the strings containing the same value will point to the same object in memory; and reference equality is much more EFFICENT!
```

## StringBuilder
- provides an efficient way to manipulate strings
- it is a manipulable string buffer
- NOTE: 
	- you will get the best performance out of the StringBuilder when you pre-size the buffer
	- the StringBuilder will grow automatically when you exceede that capacity
	
## Primitive wrapper classes
- are imutable
- Java offer automattic handling when working with primiives and primitive wrapper classes
```java
Integer a = 100; // automatic boxing -> the compiler injects Integer.valueOf(100)
int b = a;
Integer c = b;

Integer d = Integer.valueOf(100); // boxing
int e = d.intValue(); // unboxing

String s = "87.17";
double s1 = Double.parseDouble(s);
Double s2 = Double.valueOf(s);
```

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(40);
```


## Wrapper class equality
- in Java certain boxin conversions are defined to allways return back a reference to the exact same instance:
	- byte, short, int | [-128 to 127]
	- char | ['\u0000' to '\u00ff']
	- boolean | [true, false]
	
	
## Enums
- when switching on a variable of enum type, you can ommit the enum type name in the case statement
```java
enum JobType {
	Pilot
}
JobType job = JobType.Pilot;
switch (job) {
	case Pilot:
		System.out.println("pilot");
		break;
	default:
		System.out.println("default");
}
```

# Exceptions

```
Object <- Throwable
	<- Error 
			<- LinkageError
			<- ...
	(Virtual machine errors / traeted as unchecked)
	<- Exception
			<- RuntimeException
					<- NullPointerException
			(Uncheked exceptions)
			<- ...
			(Checked exceptions)
```

# Packages

- types from java.lang.* (eg. String, StringBuilder, ...) do not need to be fully qualified

Packaging the application in a JAR file:
- from IntelliJ follow the steps:
	- File -> Project Structure ...
	- Projcet Settings -> Artifacts
	- Add -> JAR -> From modules with dependencies...
	- for executable JARs choose the 'Main Class'
	- OK
- NOTE: in order to have the JAR artifact generate by IntelliJ:
	- Build -> Buidl Artifacts...
	- choose the JAR and the Action (eg. Build)
	
- NOTE: the JAR files follow the standard ZIP file format

# Interfaces

TODO: create the demo with Iterable
- an interface defines a contract that includes:
	- methods (which are `public`)
	- constants (which are `public static final`)

## Nested Types & Inner classes

- ia a type declared within another type
	- classes declared within classes or interfaces
	- interfaces declared withing classes or interfaces
- a nested type is a member of the enclosing type
	- private members of the enclosing type are visible within the nested type
	- can have all access modifiers: public, package private, protected, private
	
- nested types serve different purposes:
	1. structure and scoping:
		- there is no special relation between instances of the nested class and instances of the enclosing class
		- this happens when you have **static classes nested within classes** or **all classes nested within interfaces** or **all nested interfaces**
	2. inner classes:
		- each instance of the nested class is associated with an instance of the enclosing class
		- this happens when you have a **non-static classes nested within classes**
		- TODO: create flight iterator with nested classes
		- the nested class has 2 this references:
			- this
			- {EnclosingTypeName}.this
		- in order to instantiate an innser class:
		Flight flight = new Flight();
		Flight.City city =  flight.new City("LA");
			
# Anonymous classes
- are declared in the same place where are instantiated
- are useful when:
	- implement an interface or a class extension to provide a specific solution
- they are inner classes

```java
public class Flight implements Iterable<Integer> {
    @Override
    public Iterator<Integer> iterator() {
        return new Iterator() {
            private int i;
            @Override
            public boolean hasNext() {
                return i < 5;
            }
            @Override
            public Integer next() {
                return ++i;
            }
        };
    }
}
```

```java
package com.luckpp;
import com.luckpp.flight.Flight;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flight flight = new Flight();
        for (Integer i : flight) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```
