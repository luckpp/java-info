# Modern Java: The Big Picture

I gathered all infirmation that is new for me from the following Pluralsight course:
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/modern-java-big-picture/table-of-contents


# Java EE

- has become Jakarta EE
- is just a specification
- servers implementing those specifications: WildFly, WebSphere, Apache Tomcat (free)

# Java in the Cloud

- the cloud architecture evolves around microservices
- there are a couple of new concerns: 
	- authentication
	- authorization
	- service that need to find each other
	- rapid deployments
	- monitoring
	- tracing
- new approaches emerged in the Java ecosystem for building cloud architectures:
	- most of them can be grouped under the name 'microframeworks':
		- Spring Boot (most popular)
		- MicroProfile
		- Vert.x
		- Play Framework
		
# Libraries

## Spring Framework
- back in 2002 J2EE was heavy-weight development stack, and especially working with EJB was cumbersome
- Rod Johnson inroduced a lighter-weight alternative: Spring Framework

- the main inovations in Spring:

	- dependency injection (inversion of control) - Spring Framework is at its core a dependency injection container:
		- configuration code
		- annotations in code
		- or XML configuration
		* you can specify the objects that make up your application (those become Spring Beans)
		
		* by using Spring one can achieve:
			- decoupling
			- flexible composition
			- cross-cutting concerns: Spring inserts some interceptor between objects that handle concerns like:
				- security
				- transactionality
	
NOTE: Spring governs the structure of your whole application
		
	- integration with data-access technologies
	- integration with Java EE technologies (originally, Spring was used a lot in conjunction with Java EE applictaion servers, so reusing parts of the Java EE stack);
	
NOTE: 
- as Spring became more mature it introduced components that became real alternatives to Java EE technologies:
	- Spring WebFlux (allows building Web API in a way that is deeply integrated with the Spring Framework)
- things like Spring Boot (the microframework that is based on Spring Framework) does not need Java EE and run standalone
- Spring is the second mainstream enterprise Java development framework, next to Java EE


## Commonly Used Java Libraries

### Utility Libraries

**Google Guava**
- utility APIs that extend the functionality of Java standard library in useful ways:
	- additional collections
	- caching
	- IO helpers
	
**Apache Commons**
- extend core Java functionality
	- collections
	- CSV
	- IO
	- ... (much breader than Google Guava)
	
**Apache Log4J**
- used in many applications and in other libraries
	- structured application logging
	- allows to introduce logging statements and and send them to many different back ends (depending on the configuration)
	
### Distributed Systems Libraries

**Netty**
- popular but somewhat low-level:
	- makes it easy to build clients and servers for various protocols (HTTP, HTTP/2, WebSockets, ...)
	- it offers productive abstractions on top of underlying TCP and UDP mechanisms
	- is one of the best-performing networking libraries in the Java space
	
**Akka**
- more high-level library:
	- implements the Actor model for concurency (a model for building highly concurent applications)
	- clustering and distribution (Akka actors work within a single JVM, but you can transparently distribute them amongst the cluster)
	
**RxJava**
- Akka together with RxJava is part of the 'Reactive programming' movement
	- helps building highly concurent and resilient applications
	- async & event-based model (is all about composing streams of events)
	
**Apache Camel**
- distributed system library that wires existing systems into new workflows
	- known as Enterprise application integration
	- comes with support for many transports & connectors
	
### Data-access Libraries

- the good ting about Java is that in its core libraries, it defines a standard called Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) which outlines a standard Java API for interaction with relational databases
- there are JDBC drivers for all popular relational DBs:
	- MySQL
	- Postgres
	- Oracle
	- and even H2 DB (which is written in Java)

- the JDBC API is still too low level to be productive in
- different new abstractions emerged:
	- ORMs: Hibernate, EclipseLink
	- SQL DSls (domain specific languages): jOOQ, QueryDSL
	

## Java-based Data Processing

- a well known application area is Big Data Processing, which referes to systems that store and process large amounts of data

### Big Data: Processing

**Apache Hadoop**
- is the most well-known big data application written in Java
- is an open-source Java implementation of Google's MapReduce concept
- it is well suited for processing petabytes of data on large clusters running many instances of Hadoop
- it is not really a library, although it does offer its own programming model, but is a distributed system built in Java forprocessing bug data:
	- you typically implement a Hadoop job using the Hadoop library and then you submit it to a runnung Hadoop cluster
	- NOTE: Hadoop has several bindings for writting jobs in different programming languages
	
**Apache Spark**
- another player in the big data processing space
- similar to Haddop but newer and even more scalable implementation
- is possible to process large amounts of streaming data in Spark

**DL4J: Deep Learning for Java**
- a library for doing deep learning in Java
- in this library you can implement deep neuro networks in Java, for example to do:
	- face detection
	- object detection
	- ...

### Big Data: Storage

**Cassandra**
- a NoSQL database written in Java
- many of the tech giants run enormous clusters of Cassandra nodes that together can store petabytes of data

**Neo4J**
- a graph database written in Java

**Elasticsearch**
- a well-known big data storage solution written in Java
- is used to create efficient search indexes for big datasets

**Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**
- sits underneath the Hadoop data processing layer


# Practices and Common Tools

## IDEs
- **Eclipse**
- **IntelliJ** (which has a free version IntelliJ Community Edition)

## Unit Testing
- **JUnit**
- **Mockito**

## Build Tools
- **Maven**
	- is the most widely used build tool in Java
	- you describe your build in XML file called pom.xml
	- the XML build description is declarative in nature
		- you do not script individual build steps
		- you tell Maven about the end result -> Maven will figure out the steps to get there
	- Maven makes many assumptions about the code base (so you don't have to spell them)
```
src/
  main/
    java/
      ...
  test/
    java/
      ...
  resources/
    ...
  ```
- **Gradle**
	- is the second important Java build tool
	- the biggest difference with Maven is that builds are not specified in a declarative XML format, they are specified in Groovy scripting language
	- one improvement over Maven is that Gradle supports incremental builds
	- can unse Maven Central
	
## Continuous Integration & Quality Control
- main responsibility
	- build code
	- run tests
	- analyse code
	- deploy
- **Jenkins**
	- open-source CI server implementation written in Java
- static code analysis tools:
	- Checkstyle (enforce stylistic choices on your Java code)
	- Spotbugs (scans at the bytecode level)
	- PMD (scans at the sourcecode level)
	- SonarQube
		- more sophisticated tool
		- calls itself the continuous inspection tool
		- works in tandem with the CI server
		- keeps track of all the findings from all the code analisys tools for each build
		- tracks code coverage for unit tests
		- add its own quality checks (eg.: detecting duplicate code)
		- all information is stored in a DB + a dashboard is offered
