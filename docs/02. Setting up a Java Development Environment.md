# Setting up a Java Development Environment

I gathered all infirmation that is new for me from the following Pluralsight course: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/setting-up-java-development-environment/table-of-contents

# Installing and running Java

- install the latest JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
- after installation, make sure you edit the System Environment Variables
```
JAVA_HOME: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14\
Path: ...; C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14\bin\
```
- in order to verify that the `Path` has been correctly set use the followinng command line:
```bash
java --version
```


- access the documentation from https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/index.html

## Compile and run code manually

- create the following Java class:
```java
class Hello {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello from Java!");
	}
}
```
- compile the class:
```bash
javac Hello.java
```
- run the compiled code:
```bash
java Hello
```

- check the output:
```
Hello from Java!
```

## Use an IntelliJ

- the recommended IDE for Java development is IntelliJ
- you can download the IntelliJ Community edition from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows
